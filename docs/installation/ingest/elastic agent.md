# Elastic Agent

!!! warning "DEPRECATED"
    ‚ùå Do not deploy Elastic Agent
    
    ‚úÖ **Deploy Vector instead**

## Install Elastic Agent 
    
1. [Install Elastic Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html) either [Fleet-managed](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html) or [standalone](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-standalone-elastic-agent.html)

## Create Policy

2. Create an Agent Policy
![create_policy](../../assets/elastic_agent/create_policy.png)

3. Add Integration
![add_integration](../../assets/elastic_agent/add_integration.png)

4. Select Custom UDP Logs
![custom_udp_logs](../../assets/elastic_agent/custom_udp_logs.png)

5. Configure Custom UDP Logs integration
![integration_parameters](../../assets/elastic_agent/integration_parameters.png)

6. Make sure to add your own private networks under custom configurations. It is recommended to add your own public facing IP address scope as well.

7. Save Integration

## Deploy you policy.
- If you deployed Fleet-managed agent, just [apply your new policy to your agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/agent-policy.html#apply-a-policy).

- If you deployed standalone agent, [take your generated policy](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/create-standalone-agent-policy.html) and modify your [elastic-agent.yml](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/installation-layout.html) accordinly.

You should end up with something like:

```yaml
  - id: udp-udp-af7f0dce-57c0-498f-bc09-96ba51fd76a4
    name: fortinet.fortigate-1

                  to: event.original
          - syslog:
              field: message
        fields_under_root: true
        fields:
          internal_networks:
            - private
            - loopback
            - link_local_unicast
            - link_local_multicast
```

## Performance tunning settings

Firewalls are very chatty, so it may overflow UDP buffers on your host leading to dropping logs. 

Modify your `Elasticsearch output settings` for `Optimized for throughput`.

- If you deployed Fleet-managed agent, modify your Elaticsearch output `Perfomance Tunnig` setting for [`Throughput`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/es-output-settings.html#es-output-settings-performance-tuning-settings) directly under your [output configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-settings.html#output-settings).
- If you deployed standalone agent, modify your Elaticsearch output preset setting for [`throughput`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elasticsearch-output.html#output-elasticsearch-performance-tuning-settings) on your [elastic-agent.yml](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/installation-layout.html) directly.

Depending on your Events per Second (EPS) volume, you may need to increase performance tuning settings even further.

- Run `watch -d "column -t cat /proc/net/snmp | grep -w Udp"` on your Elastic Agent host to check if you are dropping any logs.

**Hopefully you should be dancing with your logs by now.** üï∫üíÉ
