# Core Values

Because good dashboards don’t just look good — they make sense.
Here’s what we actually care about (and what we wish others did too):

## Simplicity & Transparency

No one should need a PhD in query language to read a chart.

We keep queries simple, filters visible, and logic obvious.

If someone new can’t understand what they’re looking at, we’ve failed (and yes, we’ll fix it).

If you ever had to debug a [Fortianalyzer query](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortianalyzer/7.6.4/administration-guide/175391/sql-query-functions) (like we had 😭) you will agree on why this is so important.

## Consistent UI

Every dashboard looks and feels the same.

Noone should start "investigating" the dashobard itself, trying to find where things are.

Consistency isn't boring. It's respectful of people's cognitive load. And their retinas.

## Top-to-Bottom Importance

- **Top**: Core metrics
- **Middle**: Main fields
- **Bottom**: Detailed information

___

All feel like revolutionary concepts really now, but they are actually just common sense.

We don’t build dashboards to impress — we build them to empower.

**Clarity beats complexity.**

**Consistency beats chaos.**

**And when in doubt, simplify.**

Because the best dashboards don’t make noise — they reveal insights
