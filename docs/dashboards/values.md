# Core Values

Because good dashboards donâ€™t just look good â€” they make sense.
Hereâ€™s what we actually care about (and what we wish others did too):

## Simplicity & Transparency

No one should need a PhD in query language to read a chart.

We keep queries simple, filters visible, and logic obvious.

If someone new canâ€™t understand what theyâ€™re looking at, weâ€™ve failed (and yes, weâ€™ll fix it).

If you ever had to debug a [Fortianalyzer query](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortianalyzer/7.6.4/administration-guide/175391/sql-query-functions) (like we had ðŸ˜­) you will agree on why this is so important.

## Consistent UI

Every dashboard looks and feels the same. 

Noone should start "investigating" the dashobard itself, trying to find where things are. 

Consistency isn't boring. It's respectful of people's cognitive load. And their retinas.

## Top-to-Bottom Importance

Arrange your dashboard like you're writing a security incident report, not a mystery novel. We don't need the dramatic reveal at the bottom.

- **Top**: The metrics that would make you check Slack at 2 AM
- **Middle**: Important context and trends
- **Bottom**: Nice-to-know details and that one graph your manager asked for eight months ago

___

All feel like revolutionary concepts really now, but they are actually just common sense.

We donâ€™t build dashboards to impress â€” we build them to empower.

**Clarity beats complexity.**

**Consistency beats chaos.**

And when in doubt, **simplify.**

Because the best dashboards donâ€™t make noise â€” they tell the truth.
