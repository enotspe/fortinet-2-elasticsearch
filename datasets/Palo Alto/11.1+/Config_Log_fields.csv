Device Group Hierarchy (dg_hier_level_1 to dg_hier_level_4),dg_hier_level_1,"A sequence of identification numbers that indicate the device group’s location within a device group hierarchy. The firewall (or virtual system) generating the log includes the identification number of each ancestor in its device group hierarchy. The shared device group (level 0) is not included in this structure.
If the log values are 12, 34, 45, 0, it means that the log was generated by a firewall (or virtual system) that belongs to device group 45, and its ancestors are 34, and 12. To view the device group names that correspond to the value 12, 34 or 45, use one of the following methods:
API query:

/api/?type=op&cmd=<show><dg-hierarchy></dg-hierarchy></show>"
Virtual System Name (vsys_name),vsys_name,The name of the virtual system associated with the session; only valid on firewalls enabled for multiple virtual systems.

High Resolution Timestamp (high_res_timestamp),high_res_timestamp,"Time in milliseconds the log was received at the management plane.
The format for this new field is YYYY-MM-DDThh:ss:sssTZD:

YYYY—Four digit year

MM—Two-digit month

DD—Two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)

T—Indicator for the beginning of the timestamp

hh—Two-digit hour using 24-hour time (00 through 23)

mm—Two-digit minute (00 through 59)

ss—Two-digit second (00 through 60)

sss—One or more digits for millisecond

TZD—Time zone designator (+hh:mm or -hh:mm)


The High Resolution Timestamp is supported for logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 10.0 and later releases. Logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 9.1 and earlier releases display a 1969-12-31T16:00:00:000-8:00 timestamp regardless of when the log was received."
