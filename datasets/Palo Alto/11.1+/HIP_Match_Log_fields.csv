Field Name,Variable Name,Description
Receive Time (receive_time or cef-formatted-receive_time),receive_time,Time the log was received at the management plane.
Serial Number (serial),serial,Serial number of the firewall that generated the log.
Type (type),type,Specifies the type of log; value is HIP-MATCH.
Threat/Content Type (subtype),subtype,Subtype of HIP match log; unused.
Generated Time (time_generated or cef-formatted-time_generated),time_generated,Time the log was generated on the dataplane.
Source User (srcuser),srcuser,Username of the user who initiated the session.
Virtual System (vsys),vsys,Virtual System associated with the HIP match log.
Machine Name (machinename),machinename,Name of the user’s machine.
Operating System (os),os,The operating system installed on the user’s machine or device (or on the client system).
Source Address (src),src,IP address of the source user.
HIP (matchname),matchname,Name of the HIP object or profile.
Repeat Count (repeatcnt),repeatcnt,Number of times the HIP profile matched.
HIP Type (matchtype),matchtype,Whether the hip field represents a HIP object or a HIP profile.
Sequence Number (seqno),seqno,A 64-bit log entry identifier incremented sequentially; each log type has a unique number space.
Action Flags (actionflags),actionflags,A bit field indicating if the log was forwarded to Panorama.
Device Group Hierarchy (dg_hier_level_1 to dg_hier_level_4),dg_hier_level_1,"A sequence of identification numbers that indicate the device group’s location within a device group hierarchy. The firewall (or virtual system) generating the log includes the identification number of each ancestor in its device group hierarchy. The shared device group (level 0) is not included in this structure.
If the log values are 12, 34, 45, 0, it means that the log was generated by a firewall (or virtual system) that belongs to device group 45, and its ancestors are 34, and 12. To view the device group names that correspond to the value 12, 34 or 45, use one of the following methods:
API query:

/api/?type=op&cmd=<show><dg-hierarchy></dg-hierarchy></show>"
Virtual System Name (vsys_name),vsys_name,The name of the virtual system associated with the session; only valid on firewalls enabled for multiple virtual systems.
Device Name (device_name),device_name,The hostname of the firewall on which the session was logged.
Virtual System ID (vsys_id),vsys_id,A unique identifier for a virtual system on a Palo Alto Networks firewall.
IPv6 System Address (srcipv6),srcipv6,IPv6 address of the user’s machine or device.
Host ID (hostid),hostid,Unique ID GlobalProtect assigns to identify the host.
User Device Serial Number (serialnumber),serialnumber,Serial number of the user’s machine or device.
Device MAC Address (mac),mac,The MAC address of the user’s machine or device.
High Resolution Timestamp (high_res_timestamp),high_res_timestamp,"Time in milliseconds the log was received at the management plane.
The format for this new field is YYYY-MM-DDThh:ss:sssTZD:

YYYY—Four digit year

MM—Two-digit month

DD—Two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)

T—Indicator for the beginning of the timestamp

hh—Two-digit hour using 24-hour time (00 through 23)

mm—Two-digit minute (00 through 59)

ss—Two-digit second (00 through 60)

sss—One or more digits for millisecond

TZD—Time zone designator (+hh:mm or -hh:mm)


The High Resolution Timestamp is supported for logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 11.1 and later releases. Logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 9.1 and earlier releases display a 1969-12-31T16:00:00:000-8:00 timestamp regardless of when the log was received."
Cluster Name (cluster_name),cluster_name,(11.1 and later releases) Name of the CN-Series firewall cluster.
