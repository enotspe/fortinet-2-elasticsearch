Serial Number (serial),serial,Serial number of the firewall that generated the log.
Type (type),type,Specifies the type of log; value is USERID.
Threat/Content Type (subtype),subtype,"Subtype of User-ID log; values are login, logout, register-tag, and unregister-tag.
login—User logged in.
logout—User logged out.
register-tag—Indicates a tag or tags were registered for the user.
unregister-tag—Indicates a tag or tags were unregistered for the user."
Generated Time (time_generated or cef-formatted-time_generated),time_generated,The time the log was generated on the dataplane.
Virtual System (vsys),vsys,Virtual System associated with the configuration log.
Source IP (ip),ip,Original session source IP address.
User (user),user,Identifies the end user.
Data Source Name (datasourcename),datasourcename,User-ID source that sends the IP (Port)-User Mapping.
Event ID (eventid),eventid,String showing the name of the event.
Repeat Count (repeatcnt),repeatcnt,"Number of sessions with same Source IP, Destination IP, Application, and Subtype seen within 5 seconds."
Time Out Threshold (timeout),timeout,Timeout after which the IP/User Mappings are cleared.
Source Port (beginport),beginport,Source port utilized by the session.
Destination Port (endport),endport,Destination port utilized by the session.
Data Source (datasource),datasource,Source from which mapping information is collected.
Data Source Type (datasourcetype),datasourcetype,Mechanism used to identify the IP/User mappings within a data source.
Sequence Number (seqno),seqno,Serial number of the firewall that generated the log.
Action Flags (actionflags),actionflags,A bit field indicating if the log was forwarded to Panorama.
Device Group Hierarchy (dg_hier_level_1 to dg_hier_level_4),dg_hier_level_1,"A sequence of identification numbers that indicate the device group’s location within a device group hierarchy. The firewall (or virtual system) generating the log includes the identification number of each ancestor in its device group hierarchy. The shared device group (level 0) is not included in this structure.
If the log values are 12, 34, 45, 0, it means that the log was generated by a firewall (or virtual system) that belongs to device group 45, and its ancestors are 34, and 12. To view the device group names that correspond to the value 12, 34 or 45, use one of the following methods:
API query: /api/?type=op&cmd=<show><dg-hierarchy></dg-hierarchy></show>"
Virtual System Name (vsys_name),vsys_name,The name of the virtual system associated with the session; only valid on firewalls enabled for multiple virtual systems.
Device Name (device_name),device_name,The hostname of the firewall on which the session was logged.
Virtual System ID (vsys_id),vsys_id,A unique identifier for a virtual system on a Palo Alto Networks firewall.
Factor Type (factortype),factortype,Vendor used to authenticate a user when Multi Factor authentication is present.
Factor Completion Time (factorcompletiontime),factorcompletiontime,Time the authentication was completed.
Factor Number (factorno),factorno,"Indicates the use of primary authentication (1) or additional factors (2, 3)."
User Group Flags (ugflags),ugflags,"Displays whether the user group that was found during user group mapping. Supported values are:

User Group Found—Indicates whether the user could be mapped to a group.

Duplicate User—Indicates whether duplicate users were found in a user group. Displays N/A if no user group is found."
User by Source (userbysource),userbysource,Indicates the username received from the source through IP address-to-username mapping.
Tag Name (tag_name),tag_name,Name of the tag associated with the dynamic user group associated with the User Group the user is mapped to.
High Resolution Timestamp (high_res timestamp),high_res,"Time in milliseconds the log was received at the management plane.
The format for this new field is YYYY-MM-DDThh:ss:sssTZD:

YYYY—Four digit year

MM—Two-digit month

DD—Two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)

T—Indicator for the beginning of the timestamp

hh—Two-digit hour using 24-hour time (00 through 23)

mm—Two-digit minute (00 through 59)

ss—Two-digit second (00 through 60)

sss—One or more digits for millisecond

TZD—Time zone designator (+hh:mm or -hh:mm)


The High Resolution Timestamp is supported for logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 11.1 and later releases. Logs received from managed firewalls running PAN-OS 9.1 and earlier releases display a 1969-12-31T16:00:00:000-8:00 timestamp regardless of when the log was received."
Origin Data Source (origindatasource),origindatasource,Source where the User-ID mapping originated.
Cluster Name (cluster_name),cluster_name,(11.1 and later releases) Name of the CN-Series firewall cluster.
