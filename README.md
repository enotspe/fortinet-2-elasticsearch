## 🎯 What is FortiDragon?

Tired of expensive SIEMs that don't understand firewall logs?

**FortiDragon** is a full-featured analytics platform that transforms Fortinet (FortiGate, FortiEDR, FortiMail, FortiWeb) and Palo Alto PAN-OS logs into actionable threat intelligence without breaking the bank.

After 10+ years fighting with overpriced SIEMs that treat firewall logs as an leftover checkbox in a datasheet, we built the platform we always needed.

**No sampling. No filtering. Full visibility. Full behavioral analysis.**

### 💰 The Problem We Solve

**Traditional SIEMs force you to choose:**

- **Option A:** Log everything → Go bankrupt from licensing costs
- **Option B:** Sample/filter logs → Miss threats hiding in the gaps

**We chose Option C:** Build a platform optimized specifically for high-volume firewall logs using modern, cost-effective tech.

Built by security analysts, for security analysts

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Deep Ingestion

- **Full field parsing** - Every field from Fortinet and Palo Alto logs, not just the "important" ones
- **ECS standardization** - Translates to [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html)
- **Rich enrichment** - GeoIP, network community ID, registered domains, threat intel integration

### 📊 Unmatched Analytics

- **Purpose-built dashboards** for threat hunting (Kibana & Grafana)
- **Behavioral analysis** - Detect slow burns, lateral movement, beaconing
- **No other tool** (paid or free) has this depth of firewall log analysis

### 🛠️ Security Engineer Friendly

- **One-script deployment** for Elasticsearch components
- **Pre-configured pipelines** for Vector and Elastic Agent
- **Production-ready dashboards** on day one
- **No vendor lock-in** - swap components as needed

### 🏗️ Modular Architecture

```
Fortinet/Palo Alto → Vector/Elastic Agent → Elasticsearch/Victoria Logs → Kibana/Grafana
```

Mix and match: Every layer is swappable. Use what works for your environment.
